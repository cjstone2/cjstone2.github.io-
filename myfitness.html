    <h1 style="color:blue;">Fitness Journey</h1>
    
    <p>
        My fitness journey began in high school with cross-country running. I found joy in the discipline and saw significant improvements in my 5k times, which greatly bolstered my overall confidence. In the summer preceding my freshman year of college, a friend introduced me to weight lifting. Since then, I have been consistent, lifting approximately five times a week. This practice has been instrumental in enhancing both my physical and mental health. Most recently, I started boxing through my school's boxing club which has been great exercise and Iâ€™ve made a lot of new friends. I believe that fitness is a great chance to improve your health and make friends just as I have.
