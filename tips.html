        <strong>Getting Started:</strong> Choosing an activity, be it running, lifting, or any other form of exercise, often presents the initial challenge of determining where to start. My advice is to seek out individuals with expertise. Whether through a club, a group, or a friend, finding experienced practitioners can really help you learn your chosen activity safely and quickly. This guidance is particularly crucial in sports where proper form is essential, such as weightlifting. Learning from people who have good techniques can not only improve your performance but also lower the risk of injury.

        <strong>Consistency:</strong> It is important in fitness to stay consistent with your exercise. There have been times in my life where I have been really busy but I always try to make sure I get some exercise in. There have been times where I have only worked out three times a week for thirty minutes. I would recommend making a schedule and sticking to it. You will definitely see results.

        <strong>Goals:</strong> Setting a fitness goal can be helpful. It gives you something to aim for and achieving your goal can feel really fulfilling. You should make your goals realistic and achievable and you don’t necessarily need to set a time frame. Try not to get too worried if you don’t achieve your goal exactly because you definitely still improved even if you did not hit your desired target.
