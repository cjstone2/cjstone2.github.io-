    <h1>Mistakes</h1>
    
    <h2>These are some mistakes I have made in my fitness journey I hope you can learn from.</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Getting to caught up in goals:</strong> While making goals can be a good thing (as I talked about in my tips), they have also led me to get down on myself at times. I had the goal to get six pack abs. I eat healthy, I train abs, and I exercise constantly. Even to this day I don’t think I have good abs aesthetically and I used to be hard on myself for this. However I realized I still have very good core strength and maybe I just don’t have the best genetics for abs. Sometimes you aren't going to reach your intended goal for whatever reason but don’t let that take away from what you have gained.    
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Don't compare yourself to others:</strong> Your fitness journey is yours and you shouldn’t worry if people around you are a lot better or if they are improving faster than you. Everyone is unique and will not progress at the same rate. You have your own strengths and weaknesses just as everyone else. Anyone who judges you or makes fun of you for being weaker is probably just projecting their own insecurities and you should not feel bad.  
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Don't overwork yourself</strong> Sometimes in pursuit of improving I have got really into training and trained far longer than I should have. Over training has led me to getting injured or too tired to do other activities I have to do. Make sure you rest your body and that you don’t overwork yourself into getting injured or not having enough time or energy to do other things.
